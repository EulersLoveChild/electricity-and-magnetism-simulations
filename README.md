# Electricity and Magnetism Simulations

Below, I document some physics simulations that fall under E&M.

- Each simulation below has two plots: z vs y vs x and r (position) vs t. The former is more visual and shows (and updates) the positions of each object along with side objects (which are taken to be massless), like springs and strings. The latter plot shows how the position changes (of objects with mass) with respect to time and is a simple scatterplot.

* **The gif and picture are from clearly different runs of the experiments**

## Particle in an Electric and Magnetic Field

In this simulation, the particle is deployed with a random velocity in a random magnetic and electric field. As seen in the picture and gif, there are three unit vectors pointing from the particle:
- Magnetic Field: Magenta
- Electric Field: Cyan
- Velocity: Yellow

In the position vs t plot:
- x values are red
- y values are green
- z values are blue
